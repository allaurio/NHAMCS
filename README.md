National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Center Survey Emergency Department data from 2007 to 2015 as compressed tab-delimited text files. I added a column to each annual dataset called RECORDID, which is a concatenation of the YEAR, HOSPITALID, and PATIENTID columns, so multiple datasets can be combined without losing track of each record's provenance.
